# gh-ai response log 

This file has been created by the program gh-ai, therefore it does not entail any increase in token usage.  

The objective of this markdown file is to store the input and the prompts sent by the user making use of the program. 

# User prompts 

For each file requested by the user, its corresponding code has been generated.

# Description of what you have to do

Given the following *description* your job is to generate code based on what you are going to read inside the *description tag*.

<description>
This gh extension determines which local branches have been merged and safely deletes them.
Daily development makes it difficult to know which branch is active when there are many unnecessary branches left locally
If you squash merge a pull request, there is no history of the merge to the default branch, so you have to force delete the branch to clean it up, and you have to be careful not to accidentally delete the active branch.
</description>

In addition to the *description* the program **must** necessarily **contain** the **following functions**:

- get_local_branches
- isFullyMerged
- mark_branches
- delete_branches

## **Rules** you **must follow**:

- Make sure to generate a simple approach, implementing the most important ideas that you have been able to extract from the *description*. 
- The code must be easy to base and expand on for future improvements.
- Make sure to adress the *description* goals and rules. 

## Outputs

<Code>
Put here your generated code
</Code>

<requirements>
Write here a list of the most important ideas you have been able to extract from the *description*.

### Petition main and help functions of gh-poi.

# Code expansion

Read once again the *requirements* and the *previously generated code* written by you.

Then **generate a new approach** and make sure to add the functions described in the following sections.

## Main Function
Add to *previously generated code* a **new** **main function** whose purpose is to *parse the command line*, the code must process the possible parameters and arguments the code should be able to receive. Depending on the readed information *the function should execute the corresponding action* associated to that specific parameter.

In case there was already a main function parsing the command line you must overwrite the previous one.

### Parameters supported by the program

The parameters the program must support are: 

-v  Output the program version number
-h  Execute the program *help function*
--dry-run  Check what branches are going to be deleted without actually deleting them
--debug  Enable debug logs
--protect  Protect a <branchname> from deletion. It is possible to pass multiple branches
--unprotect  Unprotect a <branchname> local branch. It is possible to pass multiple branches

**You must add this arguments to the command line processing code inside the main function**

## Help function 

If the `-h, --help` parameter has not been specified you must add it to the processing, in that case it has to execute the **help function**.

What the said function `help` have to do is *print useful information to the user*. **You have to code the function to print the information**
It must be printed in the following order: 

- Print the `Usage` containing: **gh poi <command> [options]**.
- Print the help information *header* that contains the following information:

Delete the merged local branches

- Print a list with all the previous parameters listed above in the *Parameters section*. 
- Print the help information *footer* that contains the following information:

The program will stop execution if an unkown command is passed from the command line
- Once all the information is printed the program must finish execution.
