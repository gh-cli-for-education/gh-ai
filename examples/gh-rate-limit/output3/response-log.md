# gh-ai response log 

This file has been created by the program gh-ai, therefore it does not entail any increase in token usage.  

The objective of this markdown file is to store the input and the prompts sent by the user making use of the program. 

# User prompts 

For each file requested by the user, its corresponding code has been generated. 

## File gh-rate-limit

### Petition general idea of gh-rate-limit.

# File gh-rate-limit

# Description of what you have to do

Given the following *description* your job is to generate code based on what you are going to read inside the '''.

'''
gh-rate-limit is an extension of the Github Command Line Interface (Github CLI) whose purpose is to show the user their existing rate limits and when its resets. The program does exactly the same as executing the following command:

```bash
curl -fSsL -H "Authorization: token $(github_pat)" -X GET \
  https://api.github.com/rate_limit \
  | jq --raw-output '.resources | to_entries[] | {name: .key} + .value | "\(.name)  \(.remaining)/\(.limit)  \(.reset | strflocaltime("%H:%M:%S") )"' \
  | column -t
```

The program has some **Prerequisites** that are: 

+ It is necessary to have `Github CLI (gh) installed`, so the program must be able to verify that said program is installed.

+ It is necessary to have `js installed`, so the program is able to execute it.

The program must use the *"X-GitHub-Api-Version: 2022-11-28"* version of the gh REST API and save it as a global variable inside the program. It also contains a HTTP header with the value *Accept: application/vnd.github+json* inside a global variable.

This is a small skeleton that you should use as a guide for generating the code.

```bash
help() {
  # Here goes all the program usage and the parameters and arguments list.
  # Exit the program with code 1
}

main () {
  # Processes the command line and activates the different flags specified in the main function section.
  # Check `Prerequisites`
}
```

Make sure the program is executable.
'''

In addition to the *description* the program **must** necessarily **contain** the **following functions**:

- call

## **Rules** you **must follow**:

- Make sure to generate a simple approach, implementing the most important ideas that you have been able to extract from the *description*. 
- The code must be easy to base and expand on for future improvements.
- Make sure to adress the *description* goals and rules.

### Petition Usage

Total tokens used: **1431**
* Tokens used by the gh-ai generated prompt: **1418**.  
* Tokens used by the LLM to generate the answer: **13**.

### Petition main and help functions of gh-rate-limit.

```md
# Code expansion

Read once again the *requirements* and the *previously generated code* written by you.

Then **generate a new approach** and make sure to add the functions described in the following sections.

## Main Function
Add to *previously generated code* a **new** **main function** whose purpose is to *parse the command line*, the code must process the possible parameters and arguments the code should be able to receive. Depending on the readed information *the function should execute the corresponding action* associated to that specific parameter.

In case there was already a main function parsing the command line you must overwrite the previous one.

### Parameters supported by the program

The parameters the program must support are: 

-u  Show the 'used' rather than 'remaining' limit (Activates the `usage` flag).
-h  Prints the help information of the program.

**You must add this arguments to the command line processing code inside the main function**

## Help function 

If the `-h, --help` parameter has not been specified you must add it to the processing, in that case it has to execute the **help function**.

What the said function `help` have to do is *print useful information to the user*. **You have to code the function to print the information**
It must be printed in the following order: 

- Print the `Usage` containing: **gh-rate-limit [options]**.

- Print a list with all the previous parameters listed above in the *Parameters section*. 
- Once all the information is printed the program must finish execution.

```

### Petition call of gh-rate-limit.

```md
# Code expansion 

Read once again the *requirements* and the *previously generated code* written by you.

Then **generate a new approach** and make sure to add the functions described in the following section.

## Function call 

Use the following *description* as guide to generate the corresponding code.

```
The function makes a call to the Github REST API using the `gh api` command, utilizing local variables as headers for the call. This function translates the content in the following code block, taking into account the `usage` flag to check the remaining or percentage of usage.
```


### Query

Use the following description inside the ''' to generate a GraphQL Query to interact with the Github API v4

''' 
Translate the Rest api call inside the following codeblock into a GraphQL call
