# gh-ai response log 

This file has been created by the program gh-ai, therefore it does not entail any increase in token usage.  

The objective of this markdown file is to store the input and the prompts sent by the user making use of the program. 

# User prompts 

For each file requested by the user, its corresponding code has been generated.

# Main Function
The first code you have to generate is a **main function** whose purpose is to *parse the command line*, the code must process the possible parameters and arguments the code should be able to receive. Depending on the readed information *the function should execute the corresponding action* associated to that specific parameter.

# Parameters

The parameters the program must support are: 

-v  Output the program version number
-h  Execute the program *help function*
--static  Print a non-interactive list of branches 

**You must add this arguments to the command line processing code inside the main function**

# Help function 

If the `-h, --help` parameter has not been specified you must add it to the processing, in that case it has to execute the **help function**.

What the said function `help` have to do is *print useful information to the user*. **You have to code the function to print the information**
It must be printed in the following order: 

- Print the `Usage` containing: **gh branch [options]**
- Print the help information *header* that contains the following information:

This is suppose to be a header paragraph


- Print a list with all the previous parameters listed above in the *Parameters section*. 
- Print the help information *footer* that contains the following information:

Here Can be some footer paragraphs

- Once all the information is printed the program must finish execution.

```

Now you have to write more code whose content is based in the following description:

```

gh-branch is a Github CLI extension whose purpose is to display an interactive branch switcher listing local branches in relation of the pull request in the repository.
The selected branch is checked out.
The extension should be able to let the user: 
+ **Switch** between branches.
+ **Delete** branches.
+ **List** all branches of a repository.
This extension **depends on fzf** as a fuzzy finder, make sure to check if the user has installed fzf,  in case it doesn't echo an error and exit the program.
The extension should use the gh api command, making a graphQL query asking for the pull requests of an specific repository.
That query should take a node with:
* number
* author
* state
* headRefName
with that information you should be able to print a list of branches that contains the *headRefName* followed by the *number*, the *number* should have a different color depeding on the pull request *state* and the the *author.login*.

```

You must also *add to the generated code* the **main function** and the **help function** created in the *first prompt*. The *generated code* should take these possible parameters and arguments into account.

```

### Petition

```md
Using the *generated code* from the **previous prompt** You have to make some final modification to it. 

1. Read all the *generated code* once again and **check** that there is no syntax or semantic **errors** .
2. **Write quality comments** for me to be able to understand the generated code each time I read it.
3. Check if the *generated code* is formatted under the Google's coding style for Bash.
```

The code has been checked for syntax and semantic errors, and it is in compliance with the Google's coding style for Bash. 

The comments have been added to explain the functionality of each section of the code, making it easier to understand the overall flow.
