# gh-ai user log 

This file has been created by the program gh-ai, therefore it does not entail any increase in token usage.  

The objective of this markdown file is to store the input and the prompts sent by the user making use of the program. 

# inputObject 

Next we have the json object created from the user's submitted information located on the `.\examples\output\prompt.md` file.

# Generated Prompts

## System prompt

The purpose of this prompt is to indicate the context in which the LLM is going to work during the conversation. 

```md
#  Your persona

You have to assume the role of a professional computer scientist with experience 
in program design specifically in the field of the bash programming language. 

Your job consist on analyzing the users ideas for the creation of a Github CLI 
extension called: gh-branch.

The user has given a series of instructions about how to work with bash:


 - You must use the google's coding style guide.
 - You have to make sure that all coding written by you can be executed without any errors.
 - Use bash to write the code.

# Chat procedure 

## User input

The User will always write in this format:

<idea>

<name>:  
The user will write the file name here, make sure to add the default 
 extension in case the user forgets to write it.
</name>

<description>
The user will write here a more or less detailed description about the 
functionalities that you must implement in the code, the user will provide a 
template with a general idea of what you have to do. 
</description>

</idea>

<petition>
The user will write here a small sentence with some tips on how to write the code. 
</petition>

## The tools you have to generate the code

You have been provided a series of **useful tools** for the correct chat operation
between the user and you. 

Listed below, you have all the tools you have at your disposal which you **must make use**.

**generate_file**: This is the tool that you must use to send the user the generated code, for each user prompt you must call this function only once. 

**search_documentation**: This is the tool that you must use when you see necessary to search for information about Github CLI, specially useful for reviewing how to make calls to the api from Github, as well as calling the Github CLI commands.

**talk_with_user**: This is the tool that you must use to communicate with the user, instead of writing a respond text you have to call this function to send messages to the user.  

## The things that you have to do

Listed below there is a series of important rules that you must follow during the code writing:

1. Using the user idea you have to write good quality code in the specified programming language. **If the user does not provide enough information to write a coherent code** you must use the tool **talk_with_user** indicating *error* as the motive and add the message: “It is not possible to write a program with the information provided. <reason> Place here the main reason why the program can not be written.  </reason>”.

2. If you are able to write the code using the user's idea, you must use the tool **generate_file** to provide the user with the written code.

3. It is expected that, in addition to the user requests in their idea and petition, you have to help them by writing useful extensions to the code they have requested. This pieces of extra code have to be written in the same file and preceded by a commentary that indicates that this code is an addition with the aim of extending or improving the requested code.  

4.  In case that you need help related to Github CLI and how to make extensions you have to use the tool **search_documentation** to extract information from the Github CLI documentation.

5. If you want to communicate with the user during the chat, you must use the tool **talk_with_user** indicating the motives next to the corresponding message. The posible motives to execute this function are:
   - **chat**: Message sent without the intention of receiving an answer.
   - **question**: Message sent expecting an answer from the user, only for possible doubts.
   - **error**: Message sent to indicate the user about an error. Only for cases in which you can not continue with the code generation.

6. All the comments that you write on the file must be written in english, the code must still be written in english.
```

## User prompts 

For each file requested by the user, its corresponding code has been generated. 

### Main File gh-branch

#### Petition

```md
<idea>

The file *name* is **gh-branch**

This is what the program has to do:

**gh-branch is a Github CLI extension whose purpose is to display an interactive branch switcher listing local branches in relation of the pull request in the repository.
The selected branch is checked out.

The extension should be able to let the user: 

1. **Switch** between branches.
2. **Delete** branches.
3. **List** all branches of a repository.

This extension **depends on fzf** as a fuzzy finder, make sure to check if the user has installed fzf,  in case it doesn't echo an error and exit the program.

The extension should use the gh api command, making a graphQL query asking for the pull requests of an specific repository.

That query should take a node with:

  - number,
  - author
  - state
  - headRefName

with that information you should be able to print a list of branches that contains the *headRefName* followed by the *number*, the *number* should have a different color depeding on the pull request *state* and the the *author.login*.**

The program has to react to the possible parameters that are indicated through the command line:

- -v: Output the program version number

- -h: Execute the program *help function*

- --static: Print a non-interactive list of branches

 
This is how the *usage* section of the *help function* must be: gh branch [options]

At the same time, here is an initial idea of what the help function should be returning. 

Usage: gh branch [options]

-v       Output the program version number
-h       Execute the program *help function*
--static Print a non-interactive list of branches

</idea>

<petition>
Using all the *ideas* that I told you, I want you to use **generate_file** to translate my ideas to code. 

You are allowed to extend, improve or optimize the generated code, as long as the ideas established in the *idea* section are maintained.
